# `relint`: Regular Expression Linting VS Code Extension

The `relint` Extension is a language and framework agnostic linter for VS Code. Its main purpose is to serve as tooling for programming languages that do not yet have their own specialized linters.

## Short Demo

Here is a short demo showing two relint rules for checking [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) projects:

```jsonc
// .vscode/settings.json
{
    ...

    "relint": {
        "language": "nim",
        "rules": [
            {
                "name": "syntax-addr",
                "pattern": "(?<=\\W|^)(?:addr\\((.+)\\)|addr (.+)|addr: (.+)|(.+)\\.addr)",
                "message": "syntax: use command syntax for `addr`",
                "fix": "(addr)$1$2$3$4",
                "severity": "Warning"
            },
            {
                "name": "syntax-pragma",
                "pattern": "{\\.(.+),\\ *(.*)}",
                "message": "syntax: use spaces to separate pragmas",
                "fix": "{.$1 $2}",
                "severity": "Warning"
            }
        ]
    },

    ...
}
```

I use an awesome plugin called [Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) in conjunction with this to make issues easier to spot.

## Features

`relint` produces configurable diagnostics for *rule violations*, each of which are described by a [regular expression](https://www.regular-expressions.info/). Rule violations can also be assigned fixes, which are repeatedly applied until no matching rule violations are found. Fixes can perform one of two operations:

- **Replace** the matched text
- **Reorder** the matched text

The configuration options can be found in the `contributes.configuration` section of the [`package.json`](package.json).

# Usage Guide

To create a `relint` linting rules, modify `.vscode/settings.json` within your workspace.  
```jsonc
"relint": {
    "language": "language name or array of language names",
    "rules": [
        {
            "name": "Rule name",
            "pattern": "Java script regular expression that shows diagnostic when matched",
            "message": "Diagnostic message",
            "fix": "A string to replace the matched pattern.",
            "severity": "'Hint', 'Information', 'Warning', or 'Error'"
        },
        // More rules...
    ]
},
```

The "fix" and "message" fields can use replacements from the matched RegEx groups.
In particular, if "$1" in "fix" or "messages", then it is replaced with the contents of the first group capture, and "$2" is replaced with the second, and so on.

You can disable relint for portions of a file using an inline comment such as (in C++):
```c++
// relint: disable
```
The 
The following are comments also disable `relint`:
```c++
// relint: disabled
// relint: enable=false
// relint: enabled=false
```
To renable `relint`, use any of the following:
```c++
// relint: enable
// relint: enabled
// relint: enable=true
// relint: enabled=true
```
The inline comment must be the first content in the line of code except for empty space. 


## More examples

The following is a more complex example that uses the **reorder** feature combined with the **replace** function to organize imports at the top of a Nim file.

```jsonc
// .vscode/settings.json
{
    ...

    "relint": {
        "language": "nim",
        "rules": [
            {
                // 1
                "fixType": "reorder_desc",
                "fix": "$1",
                "message": "organization: unordered imports",
                "name": "organization-import",
                "pattern": "^import ([.\\w]+/).+"
            },
            {
                // 2
                "fixType": "reorder_asc",
                "message": "organization: unordered import group",
                "name": "organization-import",
                "pattern": "^import \\./.+"
            },
            {
                // 2.1
                "fixType": "reorder_asc",
                "message": "organization: unordered import group",
                "name": "organization-import",
                "pattern": "^import \\.\\./.+"
            },
            {
                // 2.2
                "fixType": "reorder_asc",
                "message": "organization: unordered import group",
                "name": "organization-import",
                "pattern": "^import src/.+"
            },
            {
                // 2.3
                "fixType": "reorder_asc",
                "message": "organization: unordered import group",
                "name": "organization-import",
                "pattern": "^import std/.+"
            },
            {
                // 3
                "fix": "$1\r\n$4",
                "message": "organization: bad spacing in import group",
                "maxLines": 0,
                "name": "organization-import",
                "pattern": "(^import ([.\\w]+)/.+)(\\r\\n){2,}(^import \\2/.+)"
            },
            {
                // 4
                "fix": "$1\r\n\r\n$4",
                "message": "organization: bad spacing in import group",
                "maxLines": 0,
                "name": "organization-import",
                "pattern": "(^import ([.\\w]+)/.+)(\\r\\n|(?:\\r\\n){3,})(^import (?!\\2/).+)"
            }
        ]
    },

    ...
}
```

This configuration performs the following fixes:

1. Order imports by root folder in descending alphabetical order,
1. order each *import group* in ascending alphabetical order,
1. ensures import groups are separated by 1 newline,
1. and finally, ensures imports within each import group do not have newlines between them.

The `name` configuration plays an important part here in that all rules with the same name are considered part of a *rule group*. Rules in such groups that produce diagnostics in overlapping ranges of text behave as one rule that can match multiple rule violations and apply the corresponding fixes to text in their combined ranges.

The following is a simple configuration that issues diagnostics for maximum characters exceeded in a line:

```jsonc
{
    ...

    [
        {
            "message": "format: 80 columns exceeded",
            "name": "format-line",
            "pattern": "^.{81,120}$",
            "severity": "Warning"
        },
        {
            "message": "format: 120 columns exceeded",
            "name": "format-line",
            "pattern": "^.{121,}$",
            "severity": "Error"
        }
    ]

    ...
}
```

# Development

This section describes how to set up relint for development.

Install Node.js and npm/

1. Download and install Node.js (LTS version recommended).
1. The Node Package Manager (`npm`) comes bundled with Node.js.

After installing NPM, clone this repository and open it in VS Code.
Then, to install the Node.js dependencies listed in `package.json`, run the following command within the root directory of the repo. 
```
npm install
```
Once you have all of the dependencies, you should be able to build this extension using 
```
npm run compile
```
in the root of this repository. 

## Test Extension in another Workspace 
To run this extension in a workspace—without building and installing a VS Code extension package globally—follow these steps:

0. Open the workspace where you want to test `relint`.
1. Create `.vscode/extension` as a directory relative to the root of your workspace (if it does not already exist).
2. Clone `relint` into `.vscode/extension`. The resulting path should be `.vscode/extension/relint`. 
3. Change your working directory to `.vscode/extension/relint` and run `npm install` (as described in the previous section) to install all of `relint`s depedencies. 
4. Run `npm run compile` to compile the project.
5. Open the Extensions panel and select `relint` from the "Recommended" subpanel. Click "Install Workspace Extension."
6. Run `Developer: Restart Extension Host` in the VS Code Command window (`CTRL+SHIFT+P`, by default on Windows) .

To update the extension after changing the code, repeat steps 4 and 6 (`npm run compile` and run `Developer: Restart Extension Host`).
